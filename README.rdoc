= Time Tracker with Pivotal Tracker support

This project is born as a way of teaching Ruby on Rails to La Rioja (spain) Ruby group.

We are planning to develop a time tracking application with support for companies, users and projects.  We will also make some integration with Pivotal Tracker in order to start and finish Pivotal Tracker stories from inside our app.  Nevertheless, Pivotal Tracker is not mandatory and you will be able to fully use the app without using Pivotal Tracking.

== Status: Not functional

== Technologies

This is what we are planning to learn and use along the course:

Rails 3
MySql
Haml & Sass
jQuery
Cucumber
HTML 5
CSS
Git & Github
RVM

As of this being written the best HTML5 support comes from Chrome so we will test the application with Chrome.  We are planning to degrade gracefully to support other major browers (Safari and Firefox at least).

== Instalation

Clone the application from github

  git clone git://github.com/jorgegorka/timetracker.git

Install all required gems

  bundle install

Install and rename Restfull Authentication plugin

  ruby script/rails plugin install git://github.com/Satish/restful-authentication.git
  mv vendor/plugins/restful-authentication vendor/plugins/restful_authentication

Create and setup a database for development and another one for testing

  rake db:create:all
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:seed #This will populate the database with some default info


bye
